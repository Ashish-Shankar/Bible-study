Exodus 19:3
3 Moses went up to the mountain of God. Then the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying: This is what you will say to the house of Jacob (nation of Israel); tell the Israelites: 4 You have seen how I treated the Egyptians and how I carried you up on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
5 Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my own treasured from among all the people the Earth;  for all the earth  belongs to me, 6 you will be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you must give to the Israelites.

	• .Hebrews 11:3
	 By faith, we understand that the entire universe was formed at God’s command, and that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen.
	
	
	
	• About the shape of the earth in the Bible in Isaiah 40:22
	God sits above the circle of the earth.
	    The people below seem like grasshoppers to him!
	He stretches out the heavens like a curtain
	    and makes his tent from them
	

	The word "circle" was translated from a Hebrew word {Khoog} which means spherical.
	
	• Job (Yakub) 26:7
	He spreads out the northern skies over empty space;
	    he suspends the earth over nothing.

	27 “He draws up the drops of water,
	    which distill as rain to the streams[c];
	28 the clouds pour down their moisture
	    and abundant showers fall on mankind.
	29 Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds,
	    how he thunders from his pavilion?
	30 See how he scatters his lightning about him,
	    bathing the depths of the sea.
	

	
	• Creation of the world, Science vs Christianity

Exodus 20:11  
 For six days the 
Lord made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the 
Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

The word "days" is translated from the Hebrew word { Yome } and it refers to a 24-hour period.


	
	• Adam was created somewhere around 4,000 to 10,000 B.C.

There seems to be a discrepancy between what science and God's Word say.

	• Young Earth According to the bible is somewhere between 6,000 years to 10,000 years old.

	• And It is possible to believe in an old earth and also believe in what the Word of God says?

Most conservative Christians who believe in an Old Earth believe in 1 of 2 theories:
	• Genesis Big Bang Theory.
	• Gap Theory: Many say that there is a gap between Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 and 2.
Verse 1 describes the original creation of the world which occurred billions of years ago.
Verse 2 describes the condition of the earth after destruction.

2 peter(Patrus) 2:4 =
4  God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to [b]hell and delivered them chained in the prison of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; 5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;

The History of Creation
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness [a]was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

The word "was" translated from a Hebrew word {haw-yaw} which has two meaning 
	1. Was
	2. Become

The word "without form" translated from a Hebrew word {to-hoo} which means barrenness




Scientifically Earth is supposedly 16 billion years old.

The Bible looks forward to Time.
	• From the Bible perspective creation took 6 days.
But, science looks backward into time.

	• humans were created on the 6th day the Bible begins to look at time from the earth's perspective.
 because
The Bible is God's revelation to man.

	• Albert Einstein's Theory says that time expands at the same rate as the expansion of the universe.
